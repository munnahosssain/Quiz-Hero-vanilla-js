                    <p>.forEach() is great you need to execute a function for each individual element in an array.
                        Good practice is that you should use .forEach() when you can't use other array methods to
                        accomplish your goal. I know this may sound vague, but .forEach() is a generic toolâ€¦ only
                        use it when you can't use a more specialized tool.</p> <br>
                    <p>.find() When you want to select a single element from an array.</p>

                    What is an event loop, how does it work?
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-start">
                    <p>An event loop is a programming construct that allows for efficient, non-blocking I/O in
                        event-driven programming. It is used in programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and
                        Node.js to handle asynchronous and event-based programming.</p><br>
                    <p>Here's a simple example of how an event loop works in JavaScript: <br>
                        1. Registering some event handlers, such as a click handler for a
                        button.<br>
                        2. User clicks the button, an event is triggered and added to the event queue.<br>
                        3. The event loop continuously checks the event queue for new events.<br>
                        4. When an event is found in the queue, the associated event handler is executed.<br>
                        5. The event loop then returns to checking the event queue for new events.</p>

                    quizTimer() function:
                </div>
                <div class="collapse-content text-start">
                    <p>quizTimer() function is used to create a countdown for quizzes, it has a
                        parameter(dismiss) that
                        takes a boolean value that decides to dismiss or start the timer.
                        <br><br>
                        If the value is false the function clears the interval timer and effectively stops the timer. If
                        the value is true the function runs every 1000 milliseconds and calculates the time.

                    <p>chooseQuiz() function has two parameters that are index and givenAns.The
                        function checks if an object exists in an array called answers. If it exists, the function
                        updates the givenAns property of the object with the new value. If it doesn't exists, the
                        function creates a new object and pushes it to the answers array. Finally, the function calls
                        another function called displayAnswers to show the answers.</p>
